## Projects

The idea is that you now apply everything we learned so far yourself.

This is what you need to do for each project

* Think of a problem that's interesting for you and find a dataset for that
* Describe this problem and explain how a model could be used
* Prepare the data and doing EDA, analyze important features
* Train multiple models, tune their performance and select the best model
* Export the notebook into a script
* Put your model into a web service and deploy it locally with Docker
* Bonus points for deploying the service to the cloud

## Deliverables

For a project, you repository/folder should contain the following:

* `README.md` with
  * Description of the problem
  * Instructions on how to run the project
* Data
  * You should either commit the dataset you used or have clear instructions how to download the dataset
* Notebook (suggested name - `notebook.ipynb`) with
  * Data preparation and data cleaning
  * EDA, feature importance analysis
  * Model selection process and parameter tuning
* Script `train.py` (suggested name)
  * Training the final model
  * Saving it to a file (e.g. pickle) or saving it with specialized software (BentoML)
* Script `predict.py` (suggested name)
  * Loading the model
  * Serving it via a web service (with Flask or specialized software - BentoML, KServe, etc)
* Files with dependencies
  * `Pipenv` and `Pipenv.lock` if you use Pipenv
  * or equivalents: conda environment file, requirements.txt or pyproject.toml
* `Dockerfile` for running the service
* Deployment
  * URL to the service you deployed or
  * Video or image of how you interact with the deployed service


## Evaluation Criteria

The project will be evaluated using these criteria:
* Problem description
    * 0 points: Problem is not described
    * 1 point: Problem is described in README birefly without much details
    * 2 points: Problem is described in README with enough context, so it's clear what the problem is and how the solution
will be used
* EDA
    * 0 points: No EDA
    * 1 point: Basic EDA (looking at min-max values, checking for missing values)
    * 2 points: Extensive EDA (ranges of values, missing values, analysis of target variable, feature importance analysis)
      For images: analyzing the content of the images.
      For texts: frequent words, word clouds, etc
* Model training
    * 0 points: No model training
    * 1 point: Trained only one model, no parameter tuning
    * 2 points: Trained multiple models (linear and tree-based).
      For neural networks: tried multiple variations - with dropout or without, with extra inner layers or without
    * 3 points: Trained multiple models and tuned their parameters.
      For neural networks: same as previous, but also with tuning: adjusting learning rate, dropout rate, size of the inner layer, etc.
* Exporting notebook to script
    * 0 points: No script for training a model
    * 1 point: The logic for training the model is exported to a separate script
* Reproducibility
    * 0 points: Not possitble to execute the notebook and the training script. Data is missing or it's not easiliy accessible
    * 1 point: It's possible to re-execute the notebook and the training script without errors. The dataset is committed in the project repository or there are clear instructions on how to download the data
* Model deployment
    * 0 points: Model is not deployed
    * 1 point: Model is deployed (with Flask, BentoML or a similar framework)
* Dependency and enviroment management
    * 0 points: No dependency management
    * 1 point: Provided a file with dependencies (requirements.txt, pipfile, bentofile.yaml with dependencies, etc)
    * 2 points: Provided a file with dependencies and used virtual environment. README says how to install the dependencies and how to
activate the env
* Containerization
    * 0 points: No containerization
    * 1 point: Dockerfile is provided or a tool that creates a docker image is used (e.g. BentoML)
    * 2 points: The application is containerized and the README describes how to build a contained and how to run it
* Cloud deployment
    * 0 points: No deployment to the cloud
    * 1 point: Docs describe clearly (with code) how to deploy the service to cloud or kubernetes cluster (local or remote)
    * 2 points: There's code for deployment to cloud or kubernetes cluster (local or remote). There's a URL for testing - or video/screenshot of testing it
